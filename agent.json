  "agent_summary": "Document Intelligence is an AI-powered agent that extracts structured data from PDFs and images using Azure Document Intelligence (OCR) and Azure OpenAI. It automatically detects document types (Proof of Residence, Proof of Income, Driver's License, etc.), returns confidence scores from the OCR engine, and exports normalized JSON for each document with optional summary and logs.",
  "agentUsageInstruction": "Upload one or more documents (PDF, PNG, JPG, JPEG) in the web UI. Click 'Process Documents' to run OCR and extraction. The system detects document type, extracts structured fields, and shows a progress bar. Review results in the summary table, view or download JSON per document, and optionally download the summary JSON and processing logs. Use the Dark mode toggle in the sidebar for theme preference.",
